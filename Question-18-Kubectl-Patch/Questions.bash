# Question 18 – kubectl patch
#
# Context:
#   A deployment named resource-app exists in the patch-ns namespace.
#   The current resource limits are too low for the expected workload:
#     CPU limit:    200m
#     Memory limit: 256Mi
#
# Task:
#   Using ONLY kubectl patch (not kubectl edit or kubectl apply):
#   1. Update the CPU limit of the nginx container to 500m
#   2. Update the Memory limit of the nginx container to 512Mi
#
# Constraints:
#   - You must use kubectl patch to make these changes
#   - Do not change the CPU or Memory requests
#   - The deployment must remain available (2 replicas)
#
# Verification:
#   Run the following command to confirm your changes are correct:
#
#     kubectl get deployment resource-app -n patch-ns \
#       -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources}' | python3 -m json.tool
#
#   Expected output should show:
#     "limits": { "cpu": "500m", "memory": "512Mi" }
#     "requests": { "cpu": "100m", "memory": "128Mi" }
#
