# CKA Practice (Simple Edition)

Straightforward CKA practice labs derived from the CKA-PREP playlist. Every question lives in its own folder with bash files:

**Note:** This is a living repo and may still contain bugs or rough edges. If you spot an issue—especially in lab setup or validation scripts—please open an issue so it can be fixed.

**Exam prep note:** These questions are designed to be similar to the CKA exam, but they are not meant be exact matches. Learn the underlying concepts in depth and try different scenarios so you can solve variations under exam conditions.

- `LabSetUp.bash` — set up the environment for the question.
- `Questions.bash` — the scenario text plus the YouTube link for the walkthrough.
- `SolutionNotes.bash` — a step-by-step solution when you need a hint.
- `validate.bash` — automatic validation checks to confirm your solution is correct.
- `cleanup.bash` — clean up and remove resources created during the question.

## How to Use

1. Launch the [Killercoda CKA playground](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/cka) or your own cluster.
2. Clone this repo inside the environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/santhoshkumar48321/CKA-PREP-2025-v3.git ~/CKA-PREP-2025-v3
   cd ~/CKA-PREP-2025-v3
   ```
3. Run a question setup by number:
   ```bash
   scripts/run-question.sh 5
   ```
4. Work through the task, then consult `SolutionNotes.bash` if you need help.
5. Validate your solution:
   ```bash
   scripts/validate-question.sh 5
   ```
6. Clean up resources when done:
   ```bash
   scripts/cleanup-question.sh 5
   ```

## Validating Your Solutions

Each question has a `validate.bash` script that runs automated checks against your cluster to confirm the solution is correct.

### Validate a single question
```bash
# By question number
scripts/validate-question.sh 5

# By directory name
scripts/validate-question.sh Question-5-HPA
```

### Validate all questions
```bash
scripts/validate-question.sh all
```

The script outputs `PASS` or `FAIL` for each check, with a final score summary. Exit code is `0` if all checks pass, non-zero otherwise.

## Simulated Exam Desktop (VSCodium)

You can use **VSCodium** (an open-source VS Code build) inside the Killercoda simulated desktop to edit files in a familiar IDE environment, similar to what is available in the real CKA exam.

> **NOTE: A paid Killercoda subscription is required** for the simulated desktop environment.
> Without it, the desktop GUI is not available and VSCodium cannot be launched graphically.

### Install VSCodium
```bash
scripts/install-codium.sh
```

### Launch VSCodium
Once installed, open it from inside your repo:
```bash
cd ~/CKA-PREP-2025-v3
codium --no-sandbox --user-data-dir .
```

This opens VSCodium in the current directory, allowing you to browse and edit all question files directly.

## KillerCoda Scenario Structure

This repository includes KillerCoda metadata so each question can be launched independently:

- Root `index.json` lists all question scenarios.
- Each `Question-*` directory includes `scenario.yaml`.
- Shared scenario runtime assets are in `.killercoda/`.
